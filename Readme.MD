VICE NETWORK(VN) is an open-source digital
currency based on Bitcoin's blockchain technology, Dashâ€™s Masternodes and 
Peercoin's Proof-of-stake engine. Each of these elements was combined
to create a powerful and innovative technology. We then
upgraded to Proof-of-Stake 3.0 and Bitcoin Core 0.10x code base, using Xevan
hashing algorithm with a block time of just 60 seconds.

A peer-to-peer digital currency that provides fast, zero cost
payments to anywhere around the world, without any third-party
intervention. VICE NETWORK is a fully decentralized global payment network
allowing individuals to have full control of their finances.

Masternodes require a collateral of 100,000 VN and can be run on the
Tor network for greater privacy. All transactions on the network are fully
verifiable with a built-in blockchain explorer within the software itself
